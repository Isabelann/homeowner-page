# homeowner-page
password protected homeowner page

I need a page for homeowners that will list text info, pdf documents, and a form that will upload documents and images. (I can create this)

I need a password login that is the first initial and last name of the customer. Their page name will be the same.

I need to be able to create the custom password to match the name of the html page and then have the customer go to the login page, 
use their first initial and last name lowercase and go to their already made customer page. On that page they can read every
important to them and also fill out the form, describe the work they need done, and submit photos and documents.
